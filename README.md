# Stock-price-prediction
Developed a predictive model that leverages sentiment analysis of a large collection of tweets to forecast the stock price of a publicly traded company, using Python and Generative AI.

Combined data from different sources (company's stock price and tweets) and aggregated data to calculate the average sentiment per day.

Built, trained and evaluated linear regression models using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared to identify the best model for running the prediction.
